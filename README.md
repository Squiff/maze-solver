# Maze Solver
The purpose of this app is to visualize maze solving/pathfinding algorithms. You will be able to create your own maze layout and watch as it is solved.

## Drawing The Maze
On startup you will see a blank grid. In order to draw your maze, select one of the following drawing options and click on the maze grid to apply:

* **Wall:** Set the walls of the maze, which cannot be passed through when solving.
* **Start:** Set the start point of the maze
* **Finish:** Sets the finish point of the maze
* **Path:** Set a 'blank' cell that can be used as a pathway. You can also treat this option like an eraser to remove any previously set option.

*Note: You can also click and drag to set multiple points*

## Solving
Click Start to begin solving the Maze. You will see the cells that are being evaluated in order to find a path from start to finish. A solution path will be displayed if found.
